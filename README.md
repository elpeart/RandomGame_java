Simple number guessing game written in Java

The program generates a random number between 0 and 100.
The user enters a guess, which must be an integer.  If the guess is correct, the program prints "You win!" Otherwise, it prints whether the guess was too high or too low.
Once the user reaches 100 attempts, the program prints "You lose!" and exits.
