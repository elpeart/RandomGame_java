Simple number guessing game written in Java

The program generates a random number between 0 and 100.
The user enters a guess, which must be an integer.  If the guess is correct, the program prints "You win!" and exits. Otherwise, it prints whether the guess was too high or too low. If the user input is anything other than an integer in [0,100], then it prints "You must enter an integer between 0 and 100".
Once the user reaches 50 attempts, the program prints "You lose!" and exits.
